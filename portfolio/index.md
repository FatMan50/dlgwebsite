<h2>Websites:</h2>
<p>I work in many different types of websites. I am well versed in the most popular CMS (<em>Content Management Systems</em>) such as; WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and ExpressionEngine.</p>

<p>Not every website needs the resources and complexity of a CMS. Many people can benefit from using a static website. I have built many sites using Jekyll (a static website builder). In many ways I feel that Jekyll is better than using a CMS.</p>

<p>The websites I have built and manage range from simple one page sites to full service e-commerce websites.</p> 

<p>There are many e-commerce platforms out there and I have worked with the larger ones. I have experience with Magento, Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce and a few others.</p>

<h2>What does a Website cost?</h2>
<p>That is the question isn’t it? There is no simple answer for that. It depends on your needs. The best thing to do is contact me. I’ll have a lot of questions for you.</p>

<h2>Publications</h2>
<p>I have been the Art Director and Production Manager for several nationally distributed magazines and books. I use Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator as well s FileMaker to create these publications. I built a custom database to help automate the process. This also helps in keeping track of all the different data used in the magazines and books.</p>

<p>I utilize DropBox to manage the assets of 5 different clients that are located in 3 different states. Coordinating all the people, art, and data is critical when meeting printing deadlines.</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>I work with many different whole sale print shops. This way I can get the best prices for my clients. I design all the materials and then sub-out the production. I design and produce everything: business cards, letterhead, envelopes, brochures, flyers, membership cards, posters, and even large banners.</p>
