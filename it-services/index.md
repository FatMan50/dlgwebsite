<h2>Don’t Lose Everything!!!</h2>
<p>The biggest threat to a business is <strong>NOT being hacked!</strong> The biggest threat is <strong>LOSS OF DATA!</strong> You have too much time and energy invested in your business to let it disappear over night.</p>

<p>There are computer crashes, SPAMERs, Hackers and website hijackers out there just waiting to take down your website. The two most important things you can do to help protect your site from total destruction is <strong>Backup</strong> and <strong>Maintaine!</strong></p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>An out of date website is like leaving a window open at home. It can invite unwanted guests that can steal information, and destroy your company. Regular maintenance will close and lock that window.</p>

<h3>Backup</h3>
<p>You can’t prevent a computer from crashing and destroying your data. All you can do is be ready with a recent backup. A recent, comprehensive backup can save the day and have your company running in no time.</p><br />
