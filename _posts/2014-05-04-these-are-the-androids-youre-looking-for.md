I've been a Mac addict since 1995 when I started working full time as a graphic artist. I have worked in both a Windows environment and a Mac environment in a professional setting. After over **18** years I have come to the conclusion that I prefer the Mac. I do, however think that mono-cultures are a bad thing.<!--more-->

In my personal life the machines I have at home and use are Mac and Linux based. I do have a few Windows machines collecting dust but they are either waiting to be stripped of their useful parts or to be converted to a Linux machine. That is not to say I hate the Windows environment. If the hardware is sufficient and the Windows instillation is clean and fresh it can be a pleasant piece of technology to use. But it has been my experience that well running Windows machines are few and far between. I find that Windows users have been trained to be complacent and indifferent to the difficulties Windows machines have.

So when it came time to get a smart phone many of my friends were surprised to find I chose an [Android](http://www.android.com%20) device over an iPhone. I chose the [Motorola Moto X](http://www.motorola.com/us/FLEXR1-1/Moto-X/FLEXR1.html) smart phone. I have experience setting up other people


's iPhones and my wife has an iPad so I had some experience with the iOS devices. In my opinion the difference between the [Android](http://www.android.com%20) and iOS systems are not that big, for a non-power user. For all the technical work I do, I am not a power user when it comes to mobile devices. Mostly this is due to my location, in the wilds of Southwest Florida. We have more gators than **Starbucks**, *barely*.

After researching the [Android](http://www.android.com%20) system and the different devices available I settled on the [Moto X](https://republicwireless.com/phones/moto-x). I have a soft spot for Motorola, having the same **Razr** flip phone for almost 9 years without issue made me a fan. With all things being equal it boiled down to price. When putting the [Moto X](https://republicwireless.com/phones//moto-x) up against the iPhone the winner was the Moto X thanks to Republic Wireless.

<blockquote>Republic Wireless offers the Moto X with plans as low as $5 a month. I was able to get a phone for $299 with a monthly plan of only $10 (it turns out to be $12.50 with taxes).</blockquote>

After using the phone for a few months now I can say I like it a lot. I like the wireless service and the phone is great. It does everything I want it to do at the level I expect. The [Moto X](https://republicwireless.com/phones/moto-x) works great with my **Mac** &amp; **** machines.

This doesn't mean I have changed my stance that Mac is the best. It just means that I have room in my heart for more than just one manufacturer.
