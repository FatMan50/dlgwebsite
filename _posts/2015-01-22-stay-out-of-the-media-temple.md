## I Can's say it enough, Stay Away!

They changed the server packages they offer but never told existing customers of the newly available resources. When I questioned them about being billed for inferior services than they offer on their website they told me it was my responsibility to keep abreast of their services. If I wanted to avail myself of them it was up to me to upgrade my server. <!--more-->I was told I had to purchase a second DV server and migrate everything over. Doing so turned out to be impossible, so I asked if there was a way I could pay them to migrate my sites. At this point (3rd call to them) I was told yes, for $100 they have a service for that. I said great, lets do it. They said it would be 24 to 48 hours, I said fine.

Four days later (**that is 96 hours**) I called and asked what was going on. This service representative told me they were backed up. He then told me I didn't need a second DV server and they could upgrade the existing server for $100. Again I said Great lets do it. The next day my server was upgraded, the representative told me I needed to cancel the second server ($210) and they would refund the cost.

When I tried to get a refund I was told it had been more then 5 days so I would not get a refund. Remember, it had been 5 days because I had been waiting on THEM! It took a 5th call and 40 minutes for them to agreed to refund $150 of the $210. It took another 20 minutes of arguing for them to agree to a full.

After all this I still had trouble with the server so I paid them another $79 to have them diagnose the problem. They told me to read the logs and hire a developer or refer to their knowledge base. They said I should ignore the Alerts in the Parallels control panel that they were probably incorrect. I tried the knowledge base but there are so many broken links and outdated information it is next to useless.

[Media Temple's](http://mediatemple.net) attitude toward its customers is disrespectful, their is ZERO support. Their tech support never actually ever fixes anything. Their representatives will give you a different answer for everyone you talk to. There is no consistency.


After 14 months of their poor service, spotty performance, and horrible support I recommend everyone stay away from Media Temple.
