Not many of you will recognize this, it is a 2004, Apple Power Mac G5. A Dual 1.8GHz unit with 4GB of RAM, WiFi card, two 500GB hard drives, a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 video card, running OS 10.5 Leopard, to be exact. <!--more-->

It is sad because even today it boots quickly and runs smoothly, but is so out of date it is next to useless. This was the first Mac I ever purchased. In today’s dollars I paid about **$2100**.

It was not a top of the line unit, however over the years I added more RAM, a new video card, more hard drives, and a WiFi card. The ability to do these upgrades kept this Mac as a daily driver until 2011. Seven years is a long time, in computer years. You can’t upgrade a modern Mac like that anymore.

This machine was a daily driver. It allowed me to make extra money by doing side jobs on it. Upgrading it was a great way to learn with the added benefit of making it better, faster, and more versatile.

## This is why I can’t seem to let this hunk of aluminum and plastic go.

A few times a year I plug it in and lament over how well she runs. Then, I put her back in cold-storage. 

It seems wrong to throw away (*or recycle*) something that works so well. Even if it is kind of useless.
