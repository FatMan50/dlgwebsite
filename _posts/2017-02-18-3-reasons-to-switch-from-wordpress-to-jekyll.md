![3 Reasons to Switch from WordPress to Jekyll]({{  site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/images/3-reasons-to-switch-from-wordpress-to-jekyll.jpg)

Yes! this is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyl is a Static Website Builder") driven static website. I switched to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder"), but why? There are **3** main reasons I did this. Well **4** reasons really. But the forth reason might not apply to the average person or blogger.<!--more-->

## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") is Fast
What I mean by that is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") is a static website builder. A static website is much faster than a dynamic one. [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") is dynamic, meaning it rides on a database and uses a lot of computing power to generate dynamic pages. In the most basic sense a dynamic page doesn’t exist until someone visits it. At that time [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") and the database kick to life and build the page and send it to the visitor.

Dynamic sites have their place, but the reality is most bloggers and websites really don’t need it. In the real world the average person or company isn’t as popular or feature rich as FaceBook, no matter how much we’d like that to be true. 

So lets just get the stuff we need and drop the rest. Doing so will speed up the loading of your website. In most cases simpler is faster.

## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") is Simpler
Lets be honest, neither [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") nor [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") are really that simple. As with all websites most of the work goes into the initial development. In that area [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") are fairly equal, I would even say [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") is a bit simpler. 

Beyond all the technical crap the bottom line is once the site is built the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") site is far simpler. There are no plugins to update. There isn’t a **CMS** to keep up to date. You do not have to deal with an updated plugin that conflicts with the **CMS**, or another plugin. Or my favorite head ache, the unsupported plugin. Unsupported plugins can send you scrambling for a replacement, they can also be a huge security risk.

## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") is Safer
I don’t want to get overly technical here, but there are **3** main reasons why [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") is not very secure. The first is because it uses server-side scripts, in the **PHP** language. These use whats called URL parameters to control the database (*MySQL*). Hackers can use whats called a **SQL injection attacks** to get sensitive database information. Once they have that they can hijack the site and change or replace your content.

The second reason [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") is not secure has to do with themes and plugins. You can get free themes or paid themes, same with plugins. Sometimes these themes or plugins have errors that leave a security hole in your website. Because they are easy to get and install most people will have no idea there is a security problem, the developer might not even know it. Because of the massive number of people using [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") it has become fertile ground for unscrupulous developers to add malware into their themes and plugins.

## The main problem with [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") is You!
The last reason I think [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") is not secure is **you**! And to be fare, me as well. We are human and busy humans at that. It is natural for us to let things get a bit out of date, fall behind, not keep on top of things. This can be a huge problem when dealing with [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS"). Failing to keep [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") up-to-date can leave you vulnerable to attacks.

This goes back to the simplicity problem. Many people don’t like updating [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") or plugins simply because it can cause problems. More times than I’d like to remember my day, or entire weekend, has been ruined by simply updating [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS"). I’ve done more than a few plugin updates that resulted in the dreaded **White Screen of Death**. For this reason I only do updates when I know I have a block of time that can be dedicated to fixing any possible problems.

People try to avoid problems by not updating. This might seem like a reasonable tactic but it is a ticking time bomb. Updates fix security vulnerabilities. It is just a question of time before an out of date [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") website is hacked, not if, but **when**.

Therefore a static website, which is just a collection of simple text files, is safer. There is nothing to hijack. There is nothing to take control of. There is nothing to keep updated. A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") site can be ignored as much as you want and it won’t hurt you. Its the best type of a site for a busy company or person. 

Any updates or changes doen to a Jekyll site are always done on a development machine (*your home PC*) first and not the web server. This allows you to work out any problems before they go live. Sure you could create a local version of your [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") site, but for the average person that is beyond their technical abilities.

## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") Keeps Me Sharp
This reason for using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") over [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") is very personal and may not apply to everyone. I like doing things manually, I find pleasure in knowing the inner workings of things. I feel I am a better “*technologist*” if I keep my hand in things. [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") is fine if you prefer a point and click experience. 

I bounce around a lot between graphic design, magazine and book publishing, database management, and server management. Because of this I enjoy the break from my daily grind by getting down and dirty with the command line. 

The reason I transitioned away from print, beyond it dying, and into the web was because I enjoyed the feeling of using code to create things that look good and actually do things. [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") removed a large part of that for me. I found myself spending a lot of time just maintaining the CMS and doing updates. 

There it is, my **4** reasons for using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") over [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS"). Oh, wait there is one more, **money**, and **control**, okay that is really two more. Clients can run and change a [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress is a Website CMS") site without me. Thats not good for my bottom line. A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a Static Website Builder") site I build for a client will run better, faster, more securely, and the client (*most times*) has to come to me to make changes and/or additions. It is a Win-Win for everyone.
